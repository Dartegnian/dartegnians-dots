# Dart's Dots
This public static void of a GitHub repo stores all my [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)/[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Sebastian) configuration files. This repo comes in very handy if ever my Arch Linux distro (the best distro, folks, the best) decides that it doesn't want to exist or when it wants to wet the OS partition and I have to go reinstall it again.

I made this repo in response to my entire Arch partition (the best, folks) suddenly and magically dying on me while I was using the `cp` command to copy a 1MB JPEG to a [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) [N900](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900) installation.

## What's inside

### Tmux
Tmux is a, erm, terminal multiplexor thing. It plexes your terminal emulator multiple times? I don't know. Point is: it's **AWESOME** and I feel bad if I were to use a terminal without it.

### Zsh
Zsh shell is best shell. And the config file makes it even better. So it's like best shell<sup>2</sup>. I reckon that if I add another config here, my Zsh terminal will be the best (shell<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

### Cava
Who said equalizers are a thing of the past? Just because you want *simplicity* doesn't mean you have to throw away the good ol' equalizer! Slap this *not-that-much-modified-from-the-default* config file to `~/.config/cava` and give your terminal some bling bling.

### i3
Don't care. Moving to **bspwm** anyway.
