# Dart's Dots
This public static void of a GitHub repo stores all my [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)/[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Sebastian) configuration files. This repo comes in very handy if ever my [Arch Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux) distro ([the best distro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux), folks, [the best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux)) decides that [it doesn't want to exist](https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en) or when it wants to [wet the OS partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_enuresis) and I have to go [reinstall it again](https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-Up-After-Bedwetting).

I made this repo in response to my entire Arch partition ([the best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux), folks) suddenly and [magically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criss_Angel_Mindfreak) dying on me while I was using the `cp` command to copy a 1MB JPEG to a [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/) [N900](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Nokia_N900) installation.

## What's inside

### Alacritty
[GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia)-accelerated terminal (why?). Speeds up `cmatrix` by 5 frames. Has weird `cava` glitches up the [wazoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahoo). I use `cool-retro-term` anyway.

### Bspwm
[Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm). Better than `i3`. Makes you do [binary tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-data-structure/) calculations before you can resize your windows and organize your workspace.

### Cava
Who said equalizers are a thing of the past? Just because you want *simplicity* doesn't mean you have to throw away the good ol' equalizer! Slap this *not-that-much-modified-from-the-default* config file to `~/.config/cava` and give your terminal some [musical bling bling](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware).

### Ckb-next
[Corsair iCUE](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware) for GNU/Linux. I use it because I'm a [GAMERâ„¢](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/basement-dweller) and I game on **MICROSOFT WINDOWS 10**. I don't use this anymore, too many background processes.

### Cool Retro Term
The best [POS terminal](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/26649/point-of-sale-terminal-pos-terminal) emulator for Linux. Period. Hands down. Easily. [Much wow.](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dead%20meme)

### Devilspie
The pie of the [devil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)). Used this quite a bit when I was using KDE (the K Desktop Environment) but have switched to `bspwm` and have been living a much simpler life away from the [devil's pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism) since then.

### i3
[I don't care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdZya6yATn0). Moved to `bspwm` anyway.

### MPD
The [magnetoplasmadynamic thruster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoplasmadynamic_thruster). [Doesn't want to work anyway](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/trash). Config files to be stored as a "just in case."

### Nginx
The [Engine X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_engine) [7-stage "reverse proxy"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/good-luck-im-behind-7-proxies). An integral part of my [LEMP Stack](https://lemp.io/) installation. [Harder, better, faster, stronger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harder,_Better,_Faster,_Stronger) than your typical [LAMP Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampshade) and consumes less RAM.

### Polybar
[Tiling WM](https://meteatamel.wordpress.com/2014/12/25/unnecessary-complexity-why-does-it-happen/) + `polybar` + `cava`/[some other terminal plaything](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4237/bloatware) = at least **100** upvotes on [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).

### Sxhkd
Sx... hotkey [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon)? I dunno. Custom keybindings for use with `bspwm`.

### Tmux
Tmux is a, erm, [terminal multiplexor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing) thing. It [plexes your terminal emulator](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plex_(software)) multiple times? I don't know. Point is: it's **AWESOME** and I feel bad if I were to use a terminal without it.

### Zsh
[Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) is best shell. And the config file makes it even better. So it's like best shell<sup>2</sup>. I reckon that if I add another config here, my Zsh terminal will be the best (shell<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
